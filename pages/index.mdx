Hi there! 👋 My name is Hunter Schafer (yes, spelled the same as the actress from Euphoria) and this is my website! I'm a pretty big nerd at heart and love
learning new things and figuring out how they work. Some random examples of things I think I'm (mostly) an amateur at include:

* 🍳 Cooking
* 📸 Photography (newest)
* 🍹 Bartending
* 🗣️ Languages (🇲🇽 Spanish and 🇯🇵 Japanese)
* 👾 Streaming
* 📝 Writing

Professionally, I'm a computer scientist by training, and have spent the last 5 years as a [teaching professor](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hschafer/) 
at the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen Center of Computer Science & Engineering. I've recently left that job for different opportunities.

Right now, I have zero concrete plans except trying to explore the world and learn some new things. For the next few months, I'll be traveling around 
Asia with only a vague plan of what goes next. I'll be writing about what I'm doing here, mostly for myself, but also so my friends can keep
up with my journey 😊
